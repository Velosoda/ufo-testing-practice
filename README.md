# ufo-testing-practice

The purpose of this repo is to show @dbarb911 how git works and how to create assets for a game

For new Assets:
- make sure you are on the ```new-assets``` branch 
- go to the /Assets directory
- click on the correct asset sub directory
- save assets in there


Theres going to be more here like my code for the game.
